        <h1>A User Experience Project on the CIT Atlantic Coffee Machine</h1>

        <h2>Brief Description</h2>
        <p>
            The Atlantic coffee machine is located at the 4th floor on 115 
            Waterman Street in The Thomas J. Watson Sr. Center for Information 
            Technology (CIT). It uses pods and offers a variety of hot water 
            and iced coffee options. The interface has a container for the pod, 
            a display screen, a sink, and a used pod collector inside of it. 
            It is approximately 2 feet tall and 1 foot wide. It offers espresso, 
            mild, medium, and bold varieties of coffee. The "Open" button, 
            the different choice buttons, and the pod container are some of its main 
            interactive elements.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 0px;">Problem it is Trying to Solve</h2>
        <p>
            The Atlantic coffee machine aims to address the long-standing 
            issue of graduate students in the CIT not having access to a 
            coffee maker, while also providing a variety of options and 
            reducing the amount of work required of the customer. 
            This is achieved by automating the entire process, from 
            brewing to disposal, so that all that is required of the 
            user is to insert a pod and choose an option.
        </p>
        <h2>User Interview Questions</h2>
        <p>
            Three users were interviewed in order to help build user personas. 
            The following questions were asked to each of the three users:
        </p>
        <div style="margin-left: 8%; margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 8%;">
            <ol>
                <li>Have you ever used this machine before?</li>
                <li>What would be your motive? Why would you normally use this machine?</li>
                <li>Intuitively, how would you open the compartment to insert the pod?</li>
                <li>What action would you take after placing the pod?</li>
                <li>How would you close the compartment? Is the actual way you close the compartment different from what you initially thought?</li>
                <li>When you see the message “replace used pod tray”, how would you go about it? Is it intuitive?</li>
                <li>What size cup would you use?</li>
                <li>What are the challenges you faced when using this machine?</li>
                <li>Any other observations or suggestions?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h2>Summary of User Interviews</h2>
        <div class="ul-style">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Opening the compartment and inserting a pod was a 
                    simple and seamless process for all users. 
                    But we observe that people take some time to find 
                    out how to close the compartment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The majority of them read the warning label and 
                    either realized that you had to choose the brewing 
                    mode in order to close and brew, or they took a wild 
                    guess since there were no other options like a "Close" 
                    button. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, all of them appeared to prefer to simply push 
                    the compartment shut with their hand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The task of figuring out how to empty the used pod 
                    chamber proved to be difficult for each user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ability for users to manually close the compartment, 
                    better font for the warning, and more precise instructions on how to clean the tray were some of the suggestions we got.
                </li>                
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Key Observations</h2>
        <p>
            When a sticky note was needed to explain to consumers how to 
            clean the used pod chamber once the machine became full, 
            it is clear that design improvements can be made. 
            I found that users tend to grow familiar with a device's 
            usability after using it a few times (and getting acclimated 
            to it), as they frequently repeat the same tasks every day. 
            This reduces the amount of time it takes for a user to become 
            accustomed to the device. The machine would typically be used 
            for coffee, while other users would merely use it for hot water.
        </p>
        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <p>
            The following personas were created based on the interviews 
            conducted with the three users. <br /> <b style="color: #8C5761;">Click on the images to view in a new tab!</b>

        <div class="user-personas">
            <a href="assets/persona1.png" target="_blank">                
                <div class="image-div">
                    <img src="assets/persona1.png" alt="Persona 1 of an experienced user" class="image-style" />                    
                </div>
            </a>            
            <a href="assets/persona2.png" target="_blank">            
            <div class="image-div">
                <img src="assets/persona2.png" alt="Persona 2 of a novice user" class="image-style" />                
            </div>
            </a>
        </div>
        <div class="ul-style">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first persona represents users who have some experience 
                    using the machine. It conceptualizes the fact that experienced 
                    users usually are adept at using the machine after the first 
                    one or two times and mostly stick to the same options. They 
                    do not face much difficulty, but have suggestions on how the 
                    machine design could be improved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second persona encapsulates users who are using the 
                    Atlantic coffee machine for the first time. 
                    They have difficulty figuring out a range of stuff from 
                    how to close the compartment, how to start brewing, and how 
                    to clear the pod bin. The machine usually feels a bit 
                    overwhelming at first, but eventually most of them figure 
                    out how to run the drip.
                </li>  
            </ul>    
        </div>
